    -- Built and optimized a CNN model with residual blocks to reach a 85% classification accuracy on the test set
    
    -- Implemented centre loss function to the network to improve the performance on the generated face embeddings

    -- Reached 0.92 AUC score on the test verification image set

    -- Classified the phoneme state labels for each audio recording using supervised deep learning network

    -- Designed an attention-based LAS model with Pyramidal Bi-LSTM listener encoder, speller decoder, teacher forcing, and Gumbel noise

    -- Implemented beam search to decode the prediction distribution

    -- Reached a result of less than 10 Levenshtein distance on WSJ test set
