    -- Classified the phoneme state labels for each audio recording using supervised deep learning network

    -- Designed an attention-based LAS model with Pyramidal Bi-LSTM listener encoder, speller decoder, teacher forcing, and Gumbel noise

    -- Implemented beam search to decode the prediction distribution

    -- Reached a result of less than 10 Levenshtein distance on WSJ test set

    -- Synthesized video based on source image (full body) and reference poses such as dancing videos

    -- Developed the new model using Nvidia Pix2PixHD, VGG, ResNet, and Face GAN

    -- Improved the stability and fluency of the output video using smoothing and Deblur GAN
    
    -- Supported a more flexible warping from multiple sources compared to the traditional methods such as Nearest Neighbour

  dates: August 2019
  github: FanaticKyo/Automatic_Ques_Generation_Answering
  description: |
    -- Built a Natural Language Processing system that could generate and answer questions from given documents

    -- Implemented common NLP methods (Bag-of-words, NER, POS Tagging, Smoothing, PCFG, Constituency Parsing, Coreference)

    -- Determined the similarity between generated questions and given questions using word embeddings(XLNet)

    -- Generated N best sentences ranking over their perplexity

    -- Packed up the system into a Docker image that can be fast deployed and run

  description: |
    -- Cooperated with Binder Dijker Ottezz (BDO) consulting department

    -- Analyzed the trend of recreational vehicles registration by visualizing the relationship between registration number and outside factors through ten years using Tableau

    -- Designed a data warehouse to store all of the preprocessed data

    -- Built a bidirectional RNN model to predict the future monthly sales
