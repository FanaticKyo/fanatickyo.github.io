    -- Classified the phoneme state labels for each audio recording using supervised deep learning network

    -- Designed an attention-based LAS model with Pyramidal Bi-LSTM listener encoder, speller decoder, teacher forcing, and Gumbel noise

    -- Implemented beam search to decode the prediction distribution

    -- Reached a result of less than 10 Levenshtein distance on WSJ test set

    -- Synthesized video based on source image (full body) and reference poses such as dancing videos

    -- Developed the new model using Nvidia Pix2PixHD, VGG, ResNet, and Face GAN

    -- Improved the stability and fluency of the output video using smoothing and Deblur GAN
    
    -- Supported a more flexible warping from multiple sources compared to the traditional methods such as Nearest Neighbour
